This folder is for writing, building, and running new kernels.
To write and build a new kernel, do the following:
    1. add a subdirectory here. Make sure its name does not match any other dir being built
        . just add "rahmy" to the end of the name
    2. add a cpp file of the same name to the directory. This will be your host code
    3. add a subdirectory named "kernels" to the newly named subdir. Place all your
        kernel code in there (with no naming restrictions)
    4. Update CMakeLists.txt at this level with a new entry into RAHMY_SRCS (see the file for examples)
        . this should add one line of code in that file
    5. build with $ ./build_metal.sh --build-programming-examples
    6. run with $ ./build/programming_examples/rahmy/{name of subdir}
